A few small sheel scripts to help get things moving on a new Fedora install.

Gnome Menu Editing Fix (Alacarte package)
=========================================

In Fedora 16 the menu editing (Alacarte package) was broken because of a missing
library dependency. This is a bit inconvenient, but fortunately there is a work
around for this issue. Just grab the package from Fedora 15 and copy the 
nessecary files. This shell script takes all the "hassle" out, just download 
and run it as root and it will take care of the rest.

Thanks to Michael McLaughlin for his [post outlining this fix](http://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2011/11/24/gnome-menu-editing-fix/).
